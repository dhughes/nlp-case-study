This is an approximation of the breakdown of time spent working on this case study:

**May 8**

Worked for a few hours to:
- get the node.js stuff going 
- figure out bluebird
- figure out nlp strategy

17:55 (5:55pm) - 19:22 (6:30pm) = 1:30
- Basic file reading
- Filtering reviews

**May 9**

08:15 - 09:56 = 1:45
- Everything else
